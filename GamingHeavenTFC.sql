Based on Korean mythology, the game is a standard MMO wherein players can choose between one of four character classes as their character. These classes are then leveled up via the slaying of monsters. Each class has 6 jobs (or government positions) that players can work their way through — each with their own skills. Unlike other MMOS, players are encouraged to change jobs several times in order to build the best skill set — rather than choosing one and sticking with it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to regular quests, Kalonline also features varying types of PvP, including: Castle Siege, tower defense, and more. Players can join guilds, which require six players to create.\r\n\r\nKalonline was originally released in 2004 and was made available via Steam July, 2016.','MMORPG','Windows','Inisxoft','Inisxoft','2004-06-11','Windows XP or above','Core2duo E6300 1.86GHz','1 GB','VGA 128 MB or above','2400 MB'),(308,330,'Lineage 2','A 3D fantasy MMORPG with a strong emphasis on PvP.','Lineage 2 is a 3D fantasy MMORPG with a strong emphasis on PvP allowing it to happen almost anywhere in the world. Join one of the three kingdoms with one of the thirty different classes and battle to put your kingdom on top. Published by NCSoft, Lineage 2 is a prequel to the original Lineage and is set 150 years prior to the events in Lineage. It is still centered around the PvP aspects that were present in the original Lineage.\r\n\r\nThe world spans over two continents that are ravaged by war and are in a constant struggle for power between three kingdoms. Choose from over 30 different classes that can be upgraded multiple times and customized to no end to attempt to win the war for your chosen kingdom. As you level up your class you can choose to specialize into a single class, take on a sub class, or even dual class by the end of the game.\r\n\r\nOpen world PvP allows you to choose to duel or player kill at nearly anytime. You see someone out questing killing monsters and seems unprepared for a random player ambush then you can choose to do just that and ambush them earning a bit of fame, or infamy if for the other faction, and having the satisfaction that you just bested another player.','MMORPG','Windows','NCSoft','NCSoft','2004-04-27','Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8','Intel Pentium 4 3.0 GHz / AMD Sempron 3600+','1 GB','Nvidia GeForce 6600 / ATI Radeon X 1050','20 GB'),(309,332,'Red Stone Online','A free to play 2D old school isometric MMORPG similar to Diablo.','Similar in many respects to the vaunted Diablo series, Red Stone Online is an example of classic top down isometric 2D fantasy MMORPGs.
